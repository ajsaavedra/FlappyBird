# FlappyBird
This is an implementation of Flappy Bird using the JavaFX platform.

Like the original, the user must use the space bar in order to flap the bird's wings to fly, while avoiding being hit by pipes, 
whose heights are randomly generated.

If the user fails to hit the space bar on time, the bird will stop flying and the game will end.
